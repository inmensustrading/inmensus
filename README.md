# Pipelines & Workflows
## Version Control
VC using git. Include source code, exclude generated code and binaries.

## Branches
Individual contributions to the master branch must be committed to an individual branch first, and commits merged into master later. Preferably, prior to merging into master, another member will conduct code reviews of said commits. This avoids hasty commits which break master as well as painful merge conflicts.

## Directory Organization
Directories are organized as specified in the master pipeline overview available at (WPI).
Empty directories can be primed for git's version control using an empty .gitignore.

//not sure if this is the best way to do this

# Documentation
All documentation will be organized on the Github Wiki.
